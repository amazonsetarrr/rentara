# Architecture of the Tenant Management Application

## Overview
The Tenant Management Application is designed to facilitate the management of tenants in a property management context. It consists of a frontend built with React and Vite, and a backend powered by Supabase. This document outlines the architecture of the application, including its components, data flow, and technology stack.

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React's built-in state management and custom hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Directory Structure**:
  - **src/components**: Reusable UI components
  - **src/pages**: Page-level components for different views
  - **src/hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects
  - **src/utils**: Helper functions
  - **src/services**: API calls to Supabase
  - **src/styles**: Tailwind CSS configurations
  - **src/main.jsx**: Entry point of the application

## Backend Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Migrations**: Managed through the `migrations` directory
- **Policies**: Security policies defined in `policies.sql`
- **Seeding**: Initial data seeding through `seed.sql`
- **Functions**: Optional serverless functions can be implemented in the `functions` directory

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend application through various UI components.
2. **State Management**: The application manages state using React's context and custom hooks.
3. **API Calls**: The frontend makes API calls to the Supabase backend to fetch or manipulate data.
4. **Database Operations**: Supabase handles database operations, including CRUD operations, through its API.
5. **Real-time Updates**: Supabase provides real-time capabilities, allowing the frontend to receive updates without refreshing.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Node.js (for serverless functions)
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable structure for the Tenant Management Application, leveraging modern technologies to deliver a responsive and efficient user experience.
